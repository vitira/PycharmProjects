# 5-3. Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a
# variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
alien_color = "green"

#### Write an if statement to test whether the alienâ€™s color is green. If it is, print
# a message that the player just earned 5 points.
if alien_color in "gressssssssssen":
    print("alian color is green, you earned 5 points")
else:
    print("wrong color")




#### Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that
# fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

car = ["volga", "zaz", "lada", "seat", "poloneth", "dacia"]
if "zaz" in car:
    print("this is Ukrainian car")

if "bmw" in car:
    print("something wrong with if statement")
